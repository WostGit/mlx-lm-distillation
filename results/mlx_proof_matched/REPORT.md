    ## Lean theorem alignment

    - postprocess_successCount_eq: deterministic gap = 0
    - candidateBest_postprocess_eq_lifted: candidate-best gap = 0
    - deterministic_dpi_exact: code-cost gap = 0
    - fanoStyle_valid_student_to_transcript: student valid = True, transcript valid = True
    - monteCarlo_transcript_pass_implies_student_pass: transcript pass = True, student pass = True

    ## Assumption-bug result

    Route-metadata success exceeds transcript-simulator success by 7500.

    This is not a contradiction of the Lean theorem. It means the real training function is not Transcript -> Student; it is Transcript -> RouteMetadata -> Student.
